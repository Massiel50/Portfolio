            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p> I am Massiel, the last of my kind. I was born in Dominican Republic
                    and migrated to the U.S of A very young. I grew up in bronx, New York and lived there
                   the majority of my life. I then moved to Los Angeles and lived there for 7 years.
                   Now I am here in Florida, ready to retire. I have a long ways from that.</p>
                    <p>I have studied for a bachelors in Computer Information Systems, specializing in software
                   programming. I decided that completing my degree was pointless and not cost efficient.
                   I am a very ambitious person, and to me this is a make it or break it point in my life. 
                   That's what I say to motivate myself and put a fire in me. </p>
                   <p> In my own time, I dont socialize much. Even though I don't, I can
                   make friends very easily. I stay home for the most part, though I do love
                   to sample different types of food, especially asian dining. I eat chocolate ALL the time.
                   My favorite is belgium milk chocolate. Pretty much anything sweet will float my boat. I enjoy 
                  yoga, meditation and any calm environment. I also enjoy video games, mostly rpg and simulation games.</p>
                  <p> For the most part, I go with the flow because life is too short. </p>
