        <p> I am Massiel, the last of my kind. I was born in Dominican Republic
            and migrated to the U.S of A very young. I grew up in bronx, New York and lived there
           the majority of my life. I then moved to Los Angeles and lived there for 7 years.
           Now I am here in Florida, ready to retire. I have a long ways from that.
            I have studied for a bachelors in Computer Information Systems, specializing in software
           programming. I decided that completing my degree was pointless and not cost efficient.
           I am a very ambitious person, and to me this is a make it or break it point in my life. 
           That's what I say to motivate myself and put a fire in me.
            In my own time, I dont socialize much. Even though I don't, I can
           make friends very easily. I stay home for the most part, though I do love
           to sample different types of food, especially asian dining. I eat chocolate ALL the time.
           My favorite is belgium milk chocolate. Pretty much anything sweet will float my boat. I enjoy 
          yoga, meditation and any calm environment. I also enjoy video games, mostly rpg and simulation games.
          For the most part, I go with the flow because life is too short. </p>
