Portfolio re-done with bootstrap

This a portfolio web page I created using bootstrap. I customzied font, colors and spacing using css.

There are 2 pages to my portfolio web page; the About Me page and the Contact page. You can navigate between them using the nav bar at the top right.

The About me page conatains a photo of me.
It has 2 collapsable drop downs. The first collapsable is my portfolio on a carousel.
The second collapsable is a short bio about me.
Upon clicking on my face, you will hear audio start to play. It is the first Pokemon theme song. I chose that song because like the song suggest,
"I want to be the very best, that no one ever was". I have not been able to mute it at the will of the user...but enjoy or refresh the page :D

The contact page has my contact info displayed. Underneath that is a form that which the user can use to input their own contact info, subject and leave me 
a brief message in hopes that I contact them back.
